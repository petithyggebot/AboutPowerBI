# Analyzing customer churn with Microsoft Power BI


NB : Due to license restriction, I can't share the report outside of PowerBI and the interactive dashboard so here is an overview.

I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rate.
Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. 
I'll answer these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating report pages that are understandable easily.


| Table | Columns |
| --- | --- |
| **Title 1** | test, age, bin |
| **Title 2** | test, churn rate, number customer by group |
